                  <strong><p> My work immersion experience under the School of Information Technology (SOIT) Department was a journey that provided me with lessons about teamwork, time management, discipline, and the world of technology. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that taught me three important lessons.</p>
                  <p>First, I learned the value of teamwork. In the tech industry, collaboration is key, and I experienced how working with others can lead to more efficient and innovative solutions. Effective communication and cooperation played a crucial role in completing our given tasks. Creating an e-portfolio for the first time was definitely a difficult task for me. However, I realized that no matter how difficult a task is, collective effort with your peers can make the process more manageable and even enjoyable. </p>
                  <p>Another vital skill I learned was time management. Balancing multiple tasks and meeting deadlines was a significant part of the immersion. I had to learn how to prioritize tasks, manage my schedule efficiently, and stay productive despite the workload. Since the tasks given to us were quite challenging in my opinion, it was tempting to procrastinate finishing my workload. However, this experience taught me the importance of staying organized and disciplined to ensure that projects are completed on time without compromising quality.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, discipline was another skill I developed from my immersion. Training under the SOIT Department required me to be responsible and committed to my work. I learned that discipline is essential in maintaining consistency and professionalism in the tech field</p>
                  <p>Overall, my work immersion under the SOIT Department was a learning experience. My trials and errors strengthened my technical skills and prepared me for the world of the tech industry.</p></strong>
